# HomeLab
2 Versions of what im doing. 
- A: You can virtualize everything on one machine.
- B: Or you can have hardware for everything with a hypervisor. 

Both include Using either OPNsense or Pfsense as a firewall, users choice.

# Virtualization 

For this setup I will be using a laptop that has hardware with:
- virtualization capabilites
- Min 500Gb of storage (Prefer nvme m.2 SSD but HDD works fine just abit slow)
- 32gb at 3200mhz DDR3 (Prefer 64gb with higher speeds for headroom)
- two Nic interfaces for redundancy & speed.
