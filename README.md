# HomeLab
2 Versions of what im doing. 
- A: You can virtualize everything on one machine.
- B: Or you can have hardware for everything with a hypervisor. 

Both include Using either OPNsense or Pfsense as a firewall, users choice.

# Virtualization 

For this setup I will be using a laptop that has hardware at min:
- virtualization capabilites
- Min 500Gb of storage for OS* + 1Tb of storage min. for VM's (*Prefer nvme m.2 SSD but HDD works fine just abit slow)
- 32gb at 3200mhz DDR3 of RAM (Prefer 64gb with higher speeds for headroom reasons)
- Two Nic's for redundancy & speed if possible.
- 

## Hardware 

For this setup I will be using a custom rack I 3D printed from Thingyverse. (File will be provided In another repository)
 - Router: Use any router that supports opnsense x86-64 (amd64)/pfsense x86-64 (amd64) OR mikrotik https://mikrotik.com/product/rb5009ug_s_in (the one I have)
 - Switches: 
 - UPS:
